# PNG Library - libpng, study and practice

Source code(libpng): `libpng-1.6.37.tar.gz`, `libpng-1.6.37/` and `libpng`, they are not included in this repo. This repository contains code that I wrote manually.

In order to build `libpng` within the project, you need to run `build_libpng.sh`, in order to automatically compile and run the source files in the `src` directory, you need to execute the `run.sh`.
